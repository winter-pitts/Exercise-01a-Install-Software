# Exercise-01a-Install-Software

Exercise for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington

Your first task is to create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). Once you have created the account, log in and Fork the repository.

Once the fork has completed, at the top of the repository page, you should now see `[your user name]/Exercise-01a-Install-Software`. This is the indication that it is safe for you to begin editing the repository.

First, open LICENSE, and click on the pencil icon to edit it. Change "Bl-MSCH-C220-F22" to your full name. Press the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom of the page.

The next step is to create an account on [gamedev.StackExchange.com](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/). After creating your account and logging in, tap the profile icon in the header. The URL for the page should be in following format: `https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/[user number]/[username]`. Note the user number for use later in this assignment.

Finally, you will need to create an account on [https://replit.com](https://replit.com). Your profile page should have a URL in the form of `https://replit.com/@[USERNAME]`. You will need to know your replit username to fulfill the assignment.

The following software needs to be installed on your computer:

 - [Twine 2.4.1](http://twinery.org/)
 - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

Once you have completed that process, edit this file (README.md) by pressing the pencil icon.

Once you have finished editing README.md, press the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom of the page. On the main page for this repository, copy the URL (it should be in the form: `https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-01a-Install-Software`), and submit that as the URL for the exercise on Canvas.

The final state of this file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours). If you have any problems installing the software, note it at the bottom:
